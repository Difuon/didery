Authentication
==============

Currently there is no authentication for the management api, but
requests will most likely be authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth. You
will need to provide an API key as the basic auth username. You won't
need to provide a password.

Alternatively you could also pass your API key as a bearer token in an
Authorization header.

Error Types
===========

The API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. If an error
occurs, extra information about what went wrong will be encoded in the
response as JSON. The various HTTP status codes we might return are
listed below.

HTTP Status codes

Relay Servers
=============

This endpoint is just for managing the back end. This allows you to tell
the server to broadcast updates to other trusted servers.

Add Relay Server (POST)
=======================

The POST endpoint allows you to add new servers to the broadcast list.
The server uses `RAET <https://github.com/RaetProtocol/raet>`__ to
communicate. The following fields can be used:

| **host\_address** - [string] ip address of server. *Required*
| **port** - [integer] server port to use. *Required*
| **name** - [string] name for the server. *Required*
| **main** - [boolean] The main parameter, if True, will allow that
  RoadStack to accept a vacuous join handshake from another RoadStack.
| **changed** - [ISO date string] date string for preventing replay
  attacks *Required*

Request
~~~~~~~

http POST localhost:8000/relay host\_address="127.0.0.1" port=7541

following fields can be used:

| **host\_address** - [string] ip address of server. *Required*
| **port** - [integer] server port to use. *Required*
